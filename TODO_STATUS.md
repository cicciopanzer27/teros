### Phase 2: Get to Userspace (Next 3-4 months)
1. Implement VFS + SimpleFS
2. Create minimal libc
3. Build init system and shell
4. Get basic commands working

### Phase 3: Self-Hosting (Next 6-12 months)
1. Complete toolchain
2. Add more utilities
3. Network stack
4. Lambda¬≥ integration

### Phase 4: Polish & Release (6+ months)
1. Language support features
2. Security hardening
3. Documentation
4. Testing & optimization

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Realistic Timeline

- **Minimal Bootable OS:** 6 months (1 developer)
- **Self-Hosting:** 18 months
- **Full Featured OS:** 36+ months
- **With Team (5 developers):** 12-18 months for full OS

**Current State:** Strong foundation, but ~75% of work remains.

## üí° Recommendations

1. **Focus on getting kernel bootable** - Complete memory/process management first
2. **Use existing implementations** - Consider porting musl libc, BusyBox
3. **Incremental testing** - Test each component as it's built
4. **Parallel development** - Some tasks can be done concurrently
5. **Community involvement** - Open source can accelerate development
