```
Note that the implementation of these functions is optimized for efficiency and safety. In particular, they use safe NULL pointer handling, proper bounds checking, always null-terminate strings, return appropriate values, and include clear comments for clarity. Additionally, memory leaks are avoided by using smart pointers or other memory management techniques.
